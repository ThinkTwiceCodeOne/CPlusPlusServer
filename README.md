# CPlusPlusServer
This is a webserver I'm building in C++ using features of C++ 17. Initially I'll be not maintaining any kind of folder structuring. As first I'm making a test application to check whether my server is able to get the request and send the response. After that I'll do complete folder structuring along with that I'll try to make it multithreaded
